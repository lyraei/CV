I designed and constructed an energy-efficient IoT device based on the RISC-V architecture, operating within a partially connected, self-organising mesh network. My focus was on minimising power consumption and investigating the benefits offered by using the implemented network compared to traditional topologies, particularly concerning increased reliability, range, and fault tolerance. I designed a custom PCB, including an antenna optimised for low power consumption and effective communication within the mesh network.
